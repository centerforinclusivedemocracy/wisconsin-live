      <h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
      <p>
        The Voting Location Siting Tool is designed to help election officials identify optimal sites for potential polling places, as well as provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please see the Siting Tool's current methodology below. For more details, see
        <a href="acknowledgments.html">CID's contact page</a>.
      </p>

      <h1 id="methodology">Voting Location Modeling Methodology</h1>
      <p>
        The CID acknowledges that there are many factors that go into the decision-making process for site selection. Therefore, due to the limitations of data and the need to incorporate local on-the-ground knowledge, this tool does not identify exact sites to be used.
      </p>


      <h2 id="suitable-areas">Suitable Areas</h2>
      <p>
        We identified all areas that were potentially suitable for hosting a site. We created a grid made up of 0.5 mile cells covering the entire county, where each cell is a potential area to host a site. These “suitable areas” were determined using a combined approach for road density and “points of interest” density. A suitable area needed to contain either a sufficient density of roads or at least two points of interest, while also avoiding bodies of water. This means that suitable areas are areas that have some concentration of activity and therefore are more likely to have buildings and infrastructure. Note that we are not suggesting that all points of interest are suitable sites to host a voting location, but that the presence of a point of interest suggests a general concentration of infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Points of interest were sourced from OpenStreetMap and were defined by the research team to be both governmental and non-governmental buildings (shown as two different layers in the tool) that could serve as potential voting locations.
      </p>

      <h2 id="facility-location">Facility Location</h2>
      <p>
        To generate suggested locations based on the number of sites each county has publicly reported, we used a k-means model and a series of facility location models.
      </p>
      <p>
        First we conducted a k-means cluster analysis to aggregate populated census block sites into a smaller number of computationally manageable geographic clusters. These clusters were created by clustering on latitude/longitude. Next we estimated travel time from every census block cluster to every potential area for a voting location (defined by the “suitable areas” grid).
      </p>
      <p>
        We then used a facility location model to determine optimal locations. The inputs our facility location model used were: the cost of site creation (which included the area score and the presence of points of interest), the travel time to neighboring sites, and the estimated capacity of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The facility location model selected for both the highest gain (most voters served), and the lowest penalty (high travel time and low weighted scores). These scores were generated by the indicators listed in the Data section below, and weighted based on importance. The total score was defined as the sum of individual scores across indicators, multiplied by the weights. The facility location model prefers to locate potential voting areas on sites that are near a high number of voters and/or are near a site with a high score.
      </p>

      <h2 id="scoring-model">Scoring Model</h2>
      <p>
        The data were normalized and combined in a weighted average. The weighting schema is described below in the section Variable Weights. A higher score indicates that there were multiple priority characteristics, whereas a medium score indicates that this area has some priority characteristics, but not all. For example, an area with a higher rate of eligible non-registered voter population, a higher percent disabled population and a higher percent limited English proficient population would receive a score that is higher than an area with a lower rate of eligible non-registered voter population, lower percent disabled population, and lower percent limited English proficient population.
      </p>


      <h2 id="data">Data</h2>
      <p>
        For more information on the data source and calculation of these variables see below.
      </p>
      
      <p id="votingage"><b>Percent of County Voting Age Citizens:</b> The number of citizens in this tract who are voting age, divided by the county's total number of voting age citizens.</p>

        <li><i>Calculation</i>: The percent of the population in the tract that is eligible to vote (voting age citizen) out of the total tract citizen population.</li>
        <li><i>Scale</i>: Census Tract</li>
        <li><i>Rationale</i>: Voting location/drop off should be proximal to population centers.</li>
        <li><i>Limitations</i>: Estimates can have high margins of error for small samples. Assumes people spread evenly across census tract.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p id="working"><b>Percent of County Workers:</b> The percent of all in-county workers who work in the block. Query only records for people who work and live in the same county.

          <li><i>Calculation</i>: Convert voter data to the tract level and average voter registration totals for 2012-2016. Subtract the average number of registered voters from the citizen voting age population (CVAP). Divide by the total CVAP estimate in the tract.

          <li><i>Scale</i>: Census Tract</li>
          <li><i>Rationale</i>: Voting location/drop off should be proximal to communities of eligible voters who aren’t registered to vote.</li>

          <h2 id="weighting">Variable Weights</h3>
          <p>
            In this prototype version variables were weighted equally with the exception of several variables that will receive additional weight due to being flagged as high priority. The variables that received higher weighting were voters with disabilities, voters with limited English proficiency, areas with high populations of eligible non-registered voters, areas with low VBM use for Latino and Youth voters, and areas with relatively high worker density. The variables that received the highest weight were areas with low total VBM use, areas close to public transit stops, and areas with relatively high population density.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same weighting system was used for modeling optimal ballot drop box areas, with the exception of areas with eligible non-registered voters, which received no extra weight.
          </p>

          <h2 id="gaps">Assessing Gaps in Voting Location Coverage</h3>
          <p>
            After the model selects optimal areas for voting locations, we identify areas for additional siting coverage either by geographic distance or by additional need. These areas might be considered service gaps. We are interested in seeing where additional voting locations could be placed to minimize the number of people that are more than 20 minutes travel time distance from a voting location, or to minimize the overall travel cost of all voters. The number of additional suggested areas is 10% of the total minimum required facilities.
          </p>


          <h2 id="reliability">Reliability of Estimates</h3>
          <p>
            Some data published by the American Community Survey (ACS) rely on small sample sizes, meaning that the resulting estimates can have a high degree of uncertainty. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for every ACS-based variable, where the CV is equal to the standard error (associated with 90% confidence interval) divided by the estimate (see <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2008/acs/ACSGeneralHandbook.pdf" target="_blank">ACS documentation, Appendix 1</a>). Tract estimates with a CV over 40% were considered to have a high degree of uncertainty and are flagged visually on the web map with a gray square symbol.
