            <h1>About The Tool</h1>
            <p>
              The Wisconsin Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process with multiple types of community-level demographic and voter data, each viewable in separate interactive maps. Election officials and communities can use these data to identify voting locations or to plan voter outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first phase, CID will be releasing multiple types of community-level demographic and voter data, each viewable in separate interactive maps. Communities can immediately begin using this data to start identifying voting locations or to organize voter outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              In phase two, additional data modeling by CID will bring together all the voting and demographic data into one single interactive layered map, which can then be used by communities to further identify placement of local optimized voting locations.
